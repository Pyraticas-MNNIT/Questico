			<h1>Lighting for Outdoor Events in Sussex.</h1>
<h2>Event lighting for outdoor events is crucial. Not only do your outdoor lighting options have an impact on the look and feel of your venue, but they also play a critical role in ensuring everyone can see and safely navigate their way around.</h2>
<p>Therefore, irrespective of whether you are planning a wedding or an outdoor birthday party, it's fair to say that your outdoor event lighting will significantly impact the overall success of your occasion. </p>
<p>With that in mind, let's run through what you need to take into account when deciding on your event lighting hire choices and cover the main aspects of the event that will require lighting equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Event Lighting for Your Sussex Outdoor Event: What You Need to Consider</h2>
<p>As is the case with all vital event production aspects, your outdoor <a title="Event Lighting" href="services/event-lighting">event lighting</a> will require some planning. You might want to start with the lighting design. Your lighting forms an essential element of your overall venue d&eacute;cor or style for events such as weddings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, while festoon lighting (or fairy lights, if you prefer) is undoubtedly functional, most happy couples choose to incorporate it into their event production because it works well with their overall theme. &nbsp;Venue uplighters are another excellent example of a light fixture that plays a critical role in transforming your outdoor venue into something more suitable for your specific needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, some lights will serve a purely functional role. You might want floor-based lights to illuminate a pathway or floodlights to ensure that your guests can make their way down a set of tricky outdoor stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Away from your functionality vs style ideas, you also need to consider something else &ndash; power. While indoor events usually have an array of power sockets to work with, outdoor events aren't usually as straightforward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At QOKO Events, we get around this issue by supplying a range of wireless and battery-powered party lights, meaning you don't have to worry about how you will ensure that the feature lighting elements stay illuminated. We can also supply super-silent generators and power disruption units for wired options such as festoon lights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've taken these issues into account, it's time to turn your attention to the major production areas that will require lighting. It doesn't matter whether you are putting together a <a title="Wedding Lighting" href="events/weddings">wedding lighting package</a> or an outdoor anniversary celebration; the areas of focus will be much the same.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sussex Outdoor Event Lighting: Areas to Focus On</h2>
<p>As mentioned, irrespective of the specific type of outdoor event, you will find that the areas of event production you'll be focusing on will be very similar. With that in mind, let's briefly focus on those areas you'll need to pay the most attention to.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Stage Lighting</h3>
<p>Most parties and celebrations need a spectacular stage production. To create such a stunning spectacle, you'll need to hire a range of stage lighting solutions. From stage washes to spotlights, you will likely need as many as four different types of lighting fixtures to complete your stage lighting lineup.</p>
<h3>Dance Floor Lighting</h3>
<p>The dance floor will provide the secondary focal point for your outdoor event, which will likely be taking place in a marquee or similar temporary structure. No dance floor is complete without accompanying lights and special effects machines. You'll need specialist disco lights, laser machines, and perhaps a smoke machine too.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mood Lighting for Outdoor Events</h3>
<p>Just because an event is taking place outdoors, that doesn't mean that you can't use outdoor lighting fixtures to influence the overall ambience of natural elements such as trees. Wireless LED uplighters are a great choice in this regard and are popular wedding lighting choices. They can accentuate natural features and emit all colours of the rainbow to strike the right mood for the occasion.</p>
<h3>Decorative Lighting for Outdoor Events</h3>
<p>While decorative lighting is more popular for wedding productions, they benefit all outdoor event types. There's no question that fairy lights (festoon lights) are a firm favourite in this regard. They are incredibly versatile and can be strung from point-to-point or wrapped around infrastructure (such as marquee tent poles) to give more of a "fairytale" vibe to proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
