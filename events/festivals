			<h1>Festivals.</h1>
<h2>QOKO Events specialise in delivering turnkey event production for outdoor events such as festivals, public events, and music concerts. We make your job as a live events production manager easy by taking care of all technical production aspects, allowing you to focus your time and resources on other essential elements of your event.</h2>
<p>Despite operating across Sussex and the South East, we have a scale and capacity comparable with nationwide event production companies. We stock several festival stage hire options and often supply our production services to several festivals concurrently, particularly during the busier summer months.</p>
<p>From your festival stage to your event lighting and sound equipment, our event professionals can supply and install any technical infrastructure you might need. Our industry-leading team are also on hand to provide on-site support, expertise, and advice before, during, and after the conclusion of your occasion.</p>
<h2>Why Use QOKO Events for Your Festival and Live Events Production in Sussex?</h2>
<p>At QOKO Events, we differentiate ourselves in several ways. Firstly, we own and operate all of our own production equipment. Our extensive inventory spans more than three warehouses and ensures that our team have familiarity with all of the equipment they supply, install, and operate. We do not dry hire or sub-contract equipment. Everything is delivered, collected, serviced, and maintained by our dedicated technicians and engineers.</p>
<p>Secondly, we give your event management team as much or as little support as you need. In the case of festivals, organisers are often well-versed in music industry practices and can often stipulate what they want based on artist riders and industry experience. However, suppose you are organising a local festival, and you need a helping hand throughout the whole process. In that case, we are here to help you properly plan and execute a successful event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From running through your anticipated audience figures to selecting the correct staging, we help our customers through the planning phase to ensure our collaboration results in turning the overall vision for the event into a reality.</p>
<p><img class="responsive" src="images/content/festivals-5.jpg" alt="Festival Event Production" width="1366" height="768" /></p>
<h2>Receive On-Site Support from Experienced Event Professionals Supplied by QOKO Events</h2>
<p>As part of our turnkey event production services, we offer on-site support services should you need them. For many festival organisers, it's unfeasible to have technical staff members employed for an event that only spans a few days of each year. However, you need to have a team you can trust to execute all technical elements of your festival.</p>
<p>This is where QOKO Events come in. Not only can we supply you with industry-leading technical equipment solutions, but we also boast a crack team of stage crew members, sound engineers, lighting technicians, and project managers that are all available for operations on the day(s) of your festival should you need them.</p>
<p>You might need a lighting director to create and control incredible lighting displays or a team of engineers to look after the power distribution requirements. Either way, by taking us up on the offer of on-site support, not only do you gain access to an incredible team, but they all work with the equipment day-in, day-out, allowing them to work like a well-oiled machine.</p>

<h2>What Event Production Services Can QOKO Events Supply to My Sussex Festival?</h2>
<p>While QOKO Events forte is supplying everything you could possibly need for your festival event production, it is worth running through our most popular festival event services to give you an idea of what to expect for your upcoming music or arts event.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Stage Hire for Sussex Festivals</h3>
<p>All festival and music events require at least one stage to elevate performers above the crowd and provide a focal point for proceedings. QOKO Events has a range of outdoor arc roof stages that each present an excellent staging solution for your event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From small, mobile stage options right up to headline stages that can easily support stage production projects for up to 10,000 audience members, we have everything you need. We can also supply all necessary health and safety documentation to your company regarding our stage systems to help you gain sign-off from local authorities and regulatory bodies.</p>
<h3>Event Lighting Hire for Your Sussex Festival Event</h3>
<p>Lighting is, of course, just as important a production element as any other. Your stage lighting choices will have a significant impact on the satisfaction of your fans and VIP clients. Foruintayel for you, QOKO Events happen to have one of the largest selection of festival lighting fixtures in the whole of the UK.</p>
<p>From stage blinders to lasers, stage washes, and moving "intelligent" lights, we have everything you need to put on a stunning light show for your lighting director. Contact our lighting technicians via this website to gather more information regarding our specific lighting hire options.</p>
<h3>Sound Equipment Hire for Sussex Festivals</h3>
<p>Of course, no live music or festival would be a success with top-class sound equipment. In many ways, the quality of the sound equipment you hire will decide the fate of your event. QOKO Events stock industry-leading PA systems from d&amp;b audiotechnik, the preferred choice for many leading artists. They include line arrays, stage monitors, power amps, mixing desks, and anything you require.</p>
<p>Of course, those PA systems are complemented by high-quality microphone and in-ear monitoring systems from Shure. We also supply and install distributed PA systems should you need a system for putting out news announcements to audience members spread all over your site.</p>
<h3>LED Screen Hire for Sussex Festivals and Live Events</h3>
<p>QOKO Events are Sussex's leading supplier of LED screens. They represent an excellent solution for your event management team when looking to display video content of what's happening on stage. Your event director can then deliver a superior audience experience, no matter how far away they are stood from the stage.</p>
<p>With high brightness and IP 65 ratings, our screens are designed to perform in all conditions and their 3.9mm pixel pitch ensures that even those a few metres away from the screen will enjoy an excellent viewing experience.</p>
<h3>Power and Distribution Hire for Sussex Festivals and Outdoor Events&nbsp;</h3>
<p>At QOKO Events, we realise that we can't consider our event production solution turnkey unless we supply all aspects of the technical infrastructure required for these types of events. That's why we are proud to announce we now also supply power and distribution solutions for all events that may require these services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need our business to create a tailored generator/distro solution for your event, simply contact a member of our team to discuss the options we have available.</p>

<span class="quote"><p>We needed to book a speaker sound system at short notice for the wedding reception of our son. We booked Qoko on a Thursday for a Sunday wedding. &nbsp;Kerry was very professional and helpful over the phone providing me with detailed information on how to link music on my phone to the speakers. James arrived very promptly on the Sunday to set up and stayed until everything was up and working. &nbsp;The speakers worked a treat and we were very satisfied with the service, price, quality of the equipment and reliability of the company. I would definitely recommend Qoko events and look forward to using them again for future events.</p></span>
