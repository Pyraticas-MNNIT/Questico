			<h1>Corporate Parties.</h1>
<h2>While there's always a need to work hard, corporate parties represent the perfect way to blow off steam, celebrate successes, and recognise the achievements of your employees. Corporate event parties are also an excellent way to get in front of your target audience, increase brand awareness, and meet new clients.</h2>
<p>Whatever the reason for your corporate event, QOKO Events offer turnkey event production solutions that take the weight off your shoulders and allow you to focus on other critical aspects such as event marketing, venue sourcing, or booking live entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we have made our name within Sussex for providing turnkey event solutions for occasions such as <a title="Sporting Events" href="events/sporting-events">sporting events</a> and <a title="Private Event Production" href="events/private-events">private events</a>, we have actually spent the most time within the corporate event industry. We have corporate clients that date back multiple decades; such is the longevity and quality of our operations. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you are looking to run a few fashion shows for your brand, or you simply want to let your hair down with a monthly social night at your headquarters, we provide solutions to all types of corporate events and parties.</p>
<p><img src="images/content/corporate-parties_HousePartyLEDSetup.jpg" alt="Lighting For Events in Sussex" width="1200" height="928" /></p>
<h2>What are Turnkey Event Production Services, and Why Do I Need Them for My Sussex Corporate Event?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>QOKO Events specialises in providing turnkey event production to corporate events such as product launches, conferences, office parties, Christmas parties, and similar business events. As the name suggests, we supply an event production that simply requires you to turn up &ndash; we handle the rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We help oversee and deliver all aspects of technical event production, such as event lighting, stage hire, venue decoration, sound equipment hire, and event furniture hire services. Irrespective of the event theme or style, our dedicated team focus on creating a memorable experience for employees and guests alike. We also have virtual, hybrid, and in-person events capabilities &ndash; reflecting current trends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irrespective of event type, once we have the technical requirements for your next event for you or your event planner, we go away and create an event production that more than matches your requirements. By choosing a turnkey event solutions provider, you benefit from a stress-free event host experience. You can focus on the exciting elements of event management, such as deciding the type of party you want to put on, strategising how you will engage potential customers or clients, and alerting the local press and media outlets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Partnering with our team ensures success, no matter the specific event type. From a forward-thinking conference with a party atmosphere to trade shows with live musicians, we will put on an event that will impress your participants, employees, and other influential attendees.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Choose QOKO Events as Your Sussex-based Corporate Events Production Team?</h2>
<p>At QOKO Events, not only do our dedicated team provide proactive expertise that will speak ideas and inspire your event management team, but they will also be on hand to provide solutions that stretch your company budget much further. In short, they make planning and organising these multifaceted events a breeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that a lot is riding on the success of these corporate events. Unlike a private event, you've to think about aspects such as attracting businesses to sponsor your event on top of making sure that your guests have a great time. Without the support of an experienced team with hundreds of company events under their belt, any could struggle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why we make ourselves available 24/7. Whether you need to shoot us a quick message to clarify something the evening before the event or you need in-person support to go over the key details, we will be there through every step of the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as impressive as our team is, we have developed our reputation within the Sussex event industry by supplying and installing only the best equipment in the business. Our clients benefit from best-in-class audio visual equipment, event lighting, sound systems, staging, and LED screens, to name but a few of our event production equipment items available for hire.</p>
<h2>Make Your Event Management a Breeze with Sussex Equipment Hire and Event Support Services from QOKO Events</h2>
<p>While we specialise in creating turnkey event production solutions for small events (such as a corporate party for your sales team) or larger affairs (such as conferences and product launches), it's worth breaking down our various services and areas of expertise. That way, you can better understand what you may or may not need from us for your occasion.</p>

<p>We stock and supply all-encompassing PA systems that include fixtures such as line arrays, stage monitors, power amps, mixing desks, and any other elements you might need us to deliver.

<h3>Stage Hire Services for Corporate Parties in Sussex</h3>

Whether you want a branded lectern for your post-dinner presentations and speeches or a full suite of LED furniture for your bar area, we help businesses by supplying and installing whatever they might need. <a title="Event Furniture Hire" href="services/event-furniture">View Furniture Hire...</a></p>

We booked Qoko on a Thursday for a Sunday wedding. &nbsp;Kerry was very professional and helpful over the phone providing me with detailed information on how to link music on my phone to the speakers. James arrived very promptly on the Sunday to set up and stayed until everything was up and working. &nbsp;The speakers worked a treat and we were very satisfied with the service, price, quality of the equipment and reliability of the company. I would definitely recommend Qoko events and look forward to using them again for future events.</p></span>
