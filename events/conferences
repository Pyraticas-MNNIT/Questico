			<h1>Conferences.</h1>
<h2>QOKO Events specialise in turnkey event production services for conferences across the South East of the UK. With industry-leading audio visual equipment and unrivalled on-site support, our team are here to make your event management as simple and straightforward as possible.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Our turnkey conference event management services allow you to focus on other essential aspects of your next event, such as finding the perfect venue or figuring out how to deliver your event with the lowest possible carbon footprint for your sustainability marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as you have finished your conference venue finding mission, you can relax safe in the knowledge the QOKO Events team will be able to manage any environment by calling on our decades of built-up expertise and knowledge.</p>
<h2>Benefit from All-Encompassing Conference Event Management Services from QOKO Events</h2>
<p>The success of your conference production depends heavily on the event technology and personnel you choose the oversee their installation and operation. It's tempting to save money and choose the cheapest quote for your corporate event, but the truth is that approach rarely pays off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paying more for an experienced event management team that can create any style of conference production you require is likely to lead to lasting and memorable events that have your audience lining up to sign up for future events. Plus, putting the better long-term return on investment aspect aside, &nbsp;you free yourself up to focus on other vital elements of your conference event, such as organising catering, travel arrangements, and accommodation for key delegates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of those aspects to manage on top of coming up with creative ideas to get your conference supported by a major sponsor(s), you will need the help and support of an experienced production company to ensure everything runs smoothly on the technical side of your production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given we can support you with all technical equipment, audio visual elements, and a team of lighting technicians, sound engineers, stage crew, and in-house designers, there's no better business to partner with your upcoming conference event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Choose QOKO Events for Future Events (Conferences/Gala Dinners) in Sussex?</h2>
<p>We are such a popular choice for conferences because we stock our three warehouses full of the latest and greatest audio visual, lighting, sound, and staging equipment. Those devices are then supplied, installed, and, in some cases, operated by what we believe to be one of the best conference teams in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you add in that all of that top-quality equipment is owned by us and not sub-contracted in, you can hopefully begin to understand why choosing to partner with us is as close to a guarantee of success as you can have in this competitive industry. &nbsp;We know what it takes to create the perfect conference production, and we don't stop putting in the hard work until we deliver an event production that checks off all of your objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our all-encompassing service, we will organise a meeting with you to gather more information so that we can make your jobs as easy as possible from that point onwards. We will discuss creative ideas, ascertain your development budget, chat about any possible access restrictions posed by the event venue, and start planning and creating solutions that incorporate every aspect of your event production.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Event Production Services Can QOKO Events Supply to Conference Event Organisers?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, QOKO Events provide turnkey conference production solutions that allow our clients to focus on managing other vital aspects, such as selling tickets or inviting prominent delegates and other esteemed guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's worth mentioning a few of our key event production services included within these event solutions so you can factor them into your planning process.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Event Lighting Hire for a Sussex Conference, Exhibition, or Industry Meeting</h3>
<p>Lighting will represent an essential element of your conference production efforts. Not only will lighting transform the look and feel of your venue, but it will also play a central role in lighting up the stage so everyone can see your important guests, invited keynote speakers, and presenters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our team will both help you with the planning of a venue lighting package and support you with creative ideas regarding your lighting displays. We can provide a risk/benefit analysis of each lighting fixture so that you find the perfect balance for your event.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sound Equipment Hire for Sussex Conference, Exhibition, or Industry Meeting</h3>
<p>While lighting is unquestionably an important production factor for conference venues, the sound is perhaps every bit as vital in the overall success of your event. It's no good being able to have your delegates see your guests on stage without being able to hear them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good communication is pivotal for any business event, so if your audience members go the entirety of your week-long conference without being able to hear those on stage properly, your whole production could be going to waste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer all-inclusive sound hire packages that include production items such as PA systems (including stage monitors and power amps), mixing desks, and microphones. We can also supply on-site support from sound engineers with the expertise to manage operations on the day.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Stage Hire for Sussex Conferences&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Of course, no conference event is complete without a stage. Your stage is the focal point of your production, and our team supply our clients with a range of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From "off-the-shelf" modular options that are cost-effective and easy to construct on-site for corporate meetings to custom-designed options for international conferences where budget is less of a concern &ndash; we help conference organisers to meet their stage production objectives in whichever way we can. <a title="Event Staging" href="services/staging">View Stage Hire...</a></p>
<h3>Live Streaming Services for Sussex Conferences</h3>
<p>Virtual events continue to prove popular well after they were thrust into the spotlight during the early 2020s. If you have trouble venue finding or you want your events to focus on sustainability, a virtual or hybrid event might prove more prudent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our team can supply and operate everything you need within this burgeoning event technology sector. From online meetings to large-scale conferences, we deliver every aspect of live streaming. WE stock broadcast-quality cameras, state-of-the-art video encoders, and we produce content on any streaming platform of your choosing. <a title="Conference Equipment" href="services/conference-equipment">View Conference Equipment Hire...</a></p>
<h3>Projector and Screen Hire for Sussex Meetings &amp; Conference Events&nbsp;</h3>
<p>QOKO Events has an extensive range of full-HD projectors and accompanying screens that our team can supply and install to venues right across the South East. &nbsp;They are fully adjustable and perfect for projecting images and video content to audiences of a few hundred to a few thousand individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are organising a smaller event, we also stock dozens of flatscreen TV monitors that range in size from 55" to 110". We stock state-of-the-art LED screens with a pixel pitch of just 3.9mm for national or international conferences, meaning your audience can watch video content in glorious high definition from as little as a few metres away without noticing the LED nodes. <a title="Projector &amp; Screen Hire" href="services/projectors-and-plasma-screens">View Screen Hire...</a></p>
