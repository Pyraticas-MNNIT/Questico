			<h1>Private Events.</h1>
<h2>At QOKO Events, we pride ourselves our providing turnkey event production services to private parties and other celebrations. While you may have encountered our event design and event management expertise at a corporate event or a wedding reception, we can supply all of those highly-regarded equipment hire and support services to your next event held for family and friends.</h2>
<p>So if you want to create an amazing event for your child's birthday, or you have an upcoming religious festival that you want to celebrate with your nearest and dearest, our stress-free turnkey event solutions make your event planning a breeze. Our experienced team only supply and install the highest quality equipment to ensure you create a memorable experience that will leave lasting memories for all of your guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are just as happy supplying our event services to private residences as we are a dedicated events venue, and we serve clients right across East and West Sussex and beyond. So if you are looking to put on a stunning event production, you've come to the right place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/content/private-events_FloorWithBarWedding.jpg" alt="Marquee With Lighting in Sussex" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<h2>What Are Turnkey Event Production Services for Private Parties?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In short, we supply and install all technical equipment and infrastructure requirements for your event for one straightforward price. From designing and constructing the stage to supplying rigging all of the event lighting, we handle all elements of event production for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we have sat down with us to discuss the budget, aim, vision, and ideas you have for your party or celebration, our team will get to work on creating an event that will deliver the wow factor. Our creative event team will handle all aspects from start to finish, including your preferred floral design or the type of tables and chairs you wish to hire for your party guests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our business is one of the only outfits in the UK that can offer this service using in-house equipment and personnel. Our diverse team includes staging crew, event designers, lighting technicians, and sound engineers, to name but a few. They all work diligently to supply and install our equipment solutions that span more than three Sussex warehouses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you want to utilise our corporate events experience for your big day or night, you can rest assured that we have every aspect of your private event or celebration covered. Just take a look at the kind events feedback we have received from our other private clients to appreciate our attention to detail for these types of events.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Type of Private Events Can QOKO Events Help?</h2>
<p>In short, all of them. QOKO Events can work with all event types (including virtual events) at pretty much any venue. We offer holistic event design and event management services to private individuals right across the South East.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of specific examples, it could be a milestone birthday party or a garden party to celebrate an anniversary. Another typical event project for us is religious ceremonies and celebrations or having friends and family over to watch major sporting events such as boxing or football. We have fun creating all sorts of event productions for your guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our events services are different to many other private event hire providers since we do not dry hire our range of equipment. Our holistic event production solutions are tailored to your specific circumstances and requirements to ensure success. Once you get in touch with our team to discuss the finer detail, they will work hard to deliver creative ideas and flexible solutions within budget.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Kind of Equipment and Support Services Can QOKO Events Supply to My Sussex Home or Event Venue?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>While you may be approaching us to secure a turnkey event production that allows you to focus on other vital elements of your party or celebration (such as the more creative or fun aspects), it's worth running you through some of our most common equipment requests that form part of this all-encompassing service.</p>

<h3>Event Lighting Hire for Private Sussex Events</h3>
<p>During the event planning phase, you'll need to pay attention to your lighting. No other production element has quite the same influence your lighting has. As is famously the case with weddings, you will use your lights to create the right mood and ambience for your private events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will also make specific elements of your event more appealing. For example, dance floors require disco lighting to really bring them to life. Sometimes they serve a slightly more functional aspect, such as illuminating live entertainment acts on stages. Whatever your event requirements, speak to our team about the hundreds of lighting fixtures we have available, including venue uplighters, spotlights, PAR cans, moving "intelligent" lights, festoon lighting, disco lighting, and so much more. <a title="Event Lighting" href="services/event-lighting">View Lighting Hire...</a></p>
<h3>Sound Equipment Hire for Private Events in Sussex</h3>
<p>While event lighting undoubtedly plays a vital role in your creative event design, your entire event could fall flat on its face without adequate sound equipment. Without an immersive sound system, your home cinema night will leave you feeling underwhelmed, and a live band needs to have a PA system created that can more than live up to their requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter your sound requirements, we have solutions for clients that suit all occasions. It doesn't matter if you need a few speakers for your phone to play a party playlist, or you need an entire PA system within your event space for the DJ and live band you've booked. We can create any sound setup you need and stock everything from line arrays to wireless microphones and digital mixing desks. <a title="Sound Equipment Hire" href="services/sound-equipment">View Sound Equipment...</a></p>
<h3>Sussex Stage Hire for Private Parties and Events</h3>
<p>Most events, whether private or not, require a stage to act as their focal point. Most parties will have some form of live entertainment, for example. The natural solution is to elevate them on staging platforms to draw attention and focus the event space on this aspect of your production.</p>
<p>Our stage hire options include a range of modular designs that can be assembled and customised to meet your requirements. We can also customise them with any event message or brand livery you want. We also have a range of outdoor stages with arc roof systems, and we can always create stages for parties from scratch with the expertise of our in-house team. <a title="Event Staging" href="services/staging">View Stage Hire...</a></p>
<h3>Dance Floor Hire for Your Sussex Private Event</h3>
<p>Much like a stage, a dance floor is an integral part of many private celebrations. A dance floor is a natural addition to your event production with the live entertainment performing on stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an amazing selection of dance floors for you to choose from for your Sussex birthday party or anniversary celebration. We have LED dance floor options that light up, or you could opt for a sleek black or white dance floor. We also stock wooden options and seamless dance floors for when you want to add a layer of sophistication or exclusivity to your special occasion. <a title="Dance Floor Hire" href="services/dance-floors">View Dance Floors...</a></p>
<h3>Hire an Event Marquee from Sussex-based QOKO Events&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Not only can we supply you with the entire event production, but we can also supply you with a venue in the form of a marquee. With the rise and rise of outdoor events, marquees have recently come into their own as event venues in their own right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have several different styles and designs to choose from. We stock traditional canvas marquees and more adventurous marquee options such as giant tipi party tents or trapeze marquees (stretch tents). Speak to our events team to gather more information about our marquee hire options for your party or celebration. <a title="Marquee Hire" href="services/marquees-and-structures">View Marquee Hire...</a></p>

<h2>Choose QOKO Events for Amazing Turnkey Event Productions for Your Private Event&nbsp;</h2>
<p>At QOKO Events, our mission is to create the event production of your dreams for you and your family and friends. Whether you need a marquee for your garden party or you want us to create a spectacular lighting display for your son or daughter's 21st birthday party, we have everything you need in stock, ready to make your dream become a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike smaller outfits within the UK, we own and operate all of our equipment. We control all aspects of your event's production, and all you have to do is relay your requirements directly to us (or via your party planning team), and we will handle the rest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you want to put on a memorable private event that will leave you and your guests nothing less than thrilled, we suggest getting in contact with our expert team to get the ball rolling. We look forward to working with you shortly.</p>
