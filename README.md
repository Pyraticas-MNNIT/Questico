# Questico
An authentic and unique AR-VR experience
Today in the era of virtual reality, team Pyraticas 3.0 is back yet again with its soundful idea of turning virtual experiences into reality with the help of AR and VR technologies. We are developing an educational portal where students of all ages will get AR and VR based solutions to their subjects which they feel difficult to understand and learn.

Further, the project will comprise of AR modules based on exploring difficult aspects in subjects like chemistry, physics and biology where concepts need to be understood rather than mugging them up. The idea will further shorten the rift caused due to covid 19 pandemic between students and learning. Our idea will further motivate students to learn in a more graphical and interesting manner. 

Further aspects include exploring endangered wildlife, auspicious monuments and the wide solar system, which will further motivate students towards learning rather than wasting times on social media platforms. We have also integrated air quality API so that the young upcoming generation must learn and endure what is going on in their ecosystem.

### `Problem Statement`
1. Education is the sector which suffered the maximum setback due to Covid – 19 pandemic and due to e-learning which followed by negligence.
2. Rift between conceptual knowledge and mugging up things went on increasing.
3. Interactive education has come to an end.
4. It’s difficult to understand some geometrical functions and diagrams by looking at their 2-D designs. For example, complex SCC BCC structures of solid state and        human anatomy.
5. Also the pandemic has affected the tourism a lot, many people who like to travel to different places are unable to explore the wonders of the world.


### `Proposed Solution`
1. The basic idea is to develop an Augmented and Virtual Reality based modules, which will help students to grasp concepts quickly and in a more interactive manner.
2. Complex subjects like chemistry, biology and physics that involve lots of visualizations and real life geometric models are added in different sections.
3. Students will also get to explore space modules, monuments and the solar system which will make e-learning more interesting.
4. This will help people other than students who want to see the different places but can’t find a single place which contains it all.
5. Further features include Air Quality Index section, endangered species and famous animals of different areas in the world. This will provide varied insights to the    students.


### `Implementation Details With Tech Stack (Backend)`
1. The Solution comprises of a Web Application built using HTML, JavaScript (Jquery) and bootstrap on the Frontend and NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB on the backend.
2. The backend API built using NodeJS and ExpressJS has two different modules to get the data of educational content and the tourist content.
3. The database is MongoDB connected using MongooseJS. It contains Models of Educational Content, Tourism, Animals database and Solar System models.
4. Database also contains the coordinates of the species and the entity along with its model links.


### `Implementation Details With Tech Stack (Frontend)`
1. The frontend is a Simple Web Application which has different modules that contains location markers to explore the place.
2. It uses MapTiler API to fetch the markers and world map.
3. It consists of different sections that has 3D AR models and VR videos of Educational Subjects, Tourist Location, Solar System and Endangered animals.
4. The 3D AR Models are created using the EchoAR API.
5. The Application also consists of a Fully Working Solar System which is completely built using CSS.


### `Wow Factor!`
1. AR and VR learning is a great aspect in Future tech which is a huge stone left unturned by Byju’s and Unacademy.
2. Augmented and virtual reality are milestones of the upcoming metaverse and this idea is a small step towards achieving a metaverse in e-learning.
3. The classical method of watching videos or lectures in understanding concepts could be eased with the help of achieving a greater aspect in understanding.
