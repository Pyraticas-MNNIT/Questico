An authentic and unique AR-VR experience
Today in the era of virtual reality, team Pyraticas 3.0 is back yet again with its soundful idea of turning virtual experiences into reality with the help of AR and VR technologies. We are developing an educational portal where students of all ages will get AR and VR based solutions to their subjects which they feel difficult to understand and learn.

Further, the project will comprise of AR modules based on exploring difficult aspects in subjects like chemistry, physics and biology where concepts need to be understood rather than mugging them up. The idea will further shorten the rift caused due to covid 19 pandemic between students and learning. Our idea will further motivate students to learn in a more graphical and interesting manner. 

Further aspects include exploring endangered wildlife, auspicious monuments and the wide solar system, which will further motivate students towards learning rather than wasting times on social media platforms. We have also integrated air quality API so that the young upcoming generation must learn and endure what is going on in their ecosystem.

Future aspects include monetizing the learning platform and covering the AR and VR aspect which is a great stone left unturned by tech giants like byjus and unacademy.
